Feel free to cash in your two mana to draw two cards. Two-drop getting blocked on turn three? Unload some counters to win combat and leave behind a giant threat.

At 2/3, they're passable defenders, but unexciting on the whole.

If you actually wind up with zero Deserts - which will be rare - I suppose you could consider cutting this (though I'd still play it in most decks). With a single Desert, it's a great value card.

In the world where you kill an opposing creature and then bash in for six, even if your opponent can then answer the Rattlewurm, it's likely too late for them to get back into the game.

It'll be sketchy in multiples, and you'll often be able to pick one up later in the draft.\"}","{\"name\":\"Rise of the Varmints\",\"rating\":1.5,\"comment\":\"Rise of the Varmints is a build-around payoff for self-mill strategies. It could be passable in a normal deck to try for two or three tokens, but I wouldn't be excited about that due to the inability to cast it in the early game.On the other hand, if you have a high creature count and a bit of dedicated self-mill, it seems realistic to generate four or more Varmints, which is a game-winning play.

Add the fact that it can commit it's own crimes (in addition to bleeding out opponents at a low life total), and you have a creature that's going to do a ton of work. This thing looks really scary, and I won't be surprised if it proves to be of first-pick quality.\"}","{\"name\":\"Caustic Bronco\",\"rating\":4.0,\"comment\":\"If Caustic Bronco is able to attack uncontested, then it's a . If it's able to attack while saddled, it's a Dark Confidant with no downside that can randomly spike the opponent for six or seven damage!

There's one of these in every set and they're usually okay. This one gives you a Treasure. Sure.\"}","{\"name\":\"Lively Dirge\",\"rating\":1.5,\"comment\":\"I'm not terribly excited about the Dirge. The best case scenario if you send two above-rate two drops from your graveyard to the battlefield, but I feel like you'll typically have to spend the extra mana to help set that up. At four or five mana with some setup and deckbuilding requirements, that doesn't seem like the liveliest payoff.\"}","{\"name\":\"Mourner's Surprise\",\"rating\":2.5,\"comment\":\"I think we have a surprise case of the common version being stronger than the uncommon version. Mourner's Surprise is like a two-mana  (granted you can't Gravedigger your Gravedigger in this case). Regardless, it looks much cleaner and simpler than . I'll be happy to start one of these in my black decks.\"}","{\"name\":\"Raven of Fell Omens\",\"rating\":2.5,\"comment\":\"There's a relatively higher likelihood that I'll misevaluate a card like Raven of Fell Omens. It's unusual and format-specific. It could range from the low end of \\\"under-rate for its mana cost\\\" to \\\"build-around for one of the best archetypes in the set.\\\" On day one, I'll say that it's between those two poles, hopefully leaning more towards the high side than the low.It seems like without much effort, a \\\"normal\\\" deck in this format will trigger the Raven two or three times in a medium-length game simply through the normal course of removal spells and abilities of creatures. That's pretty reasonable and balanced, and roughly makes up for the lack of a second point of power. However, to make it really good you want to find repeatable ways to commit crimes, like the ability on Blood Hustler.\"}","{\"name\":\"Servant of the Stinger\",\"rating\":3.5,\"comment\":\"Servant of the Stinger is a cool card, as a 1/3 deathtouch is already a nightmare to get into combat with. Without a ton of effort, you can put your opponent in a spot where they're making an unfavorable block, or else letting you upgrade Servant into your best card. With the way Play Boosters and bonus sheets factor into modern-day Limited, almost every deck has at least a couple of rares, and one of those is likely to sting!\"}","{\"name\":\"Shoot the Sheriff\",\"rating\":3.5,\"comment\":\"Shoot the Sherriff kills roughly half the creatures in the format, and does it at tremendous efficiency. I like that it's really good against Mounts, which will represent a lot of the largest creatures on the battlefield, and the ones that are most profitable to kill at instant-speed.While this will range in quality based on the opponent's deck, everyone will have targets. So I believe this is a case where you should take and play as many as you can get, and rarely sideboard them out. You want to be the one who shot the sheriff (and not the deputy).\"}","{\"name\":\"Treasure Dredger\",\"rating\":3.0,\"comment\":\"Treasure Dredger is a cool card that allows you to \\\"bank\\\" an unused mana on any turn for use later.

That's weak, but not disastrous. In the best case scenario, you're paying two mana for a 3/2 flying, which is massively above rate. Across the range of outcomes, and factoring some snags related to setting up optimal conditions, I consider Blacksnag Buzzard to be a strong filler-level creature.\"}","{\"name\":\"Kaervek, the Punisher\",\"rating\":4.0,\"comment\":\"Kaervek represents yet another payoff for committing crimes. Where other payoffs are about gradual accumulation of value, what makes Kaervek special is that a single well-executed crime can swing the game into your favor. So while repeatable crimes are still welcome, a single turn where you play a removal spell and then cast the best black card in your graveyard might be all you need. Kaervek is awesome, and will represent a \\\"must-kill-immediately\\\" from the opponent's perspective.Two notes that may not be obvious. First, if you cast a removal spell, Kaervek will trigger before the spell hits your graveyard, so you don't get to effortlessly double all of your spells. Second, Kaervek is a black-heavy commitment, as you'll want a density of both black mana and black spells. He'll be a lot weaker if black is your secondary color.\"}","{\"name\":\"Neutralize the Guards\",\"rating\":2.5,\"comment\":\"This type of effect can range from sideboard material to borderline bomb based on context and format.

I'm starting out pretty high on Neutralize the Guards.\"}","{\"name\":\"Rakish Crew\",\"rating\":3.0,\"comment\":\"Rakish Crew is a powerful build-around card. It would be weak in a deck with no other outlaws, and amazing in a deck full of outlaws and sacrifice synergies. What remains is the important question of how strong we can expect it to be in a typical black deck. How worthwhile is Rakish Crew is 60 percent of your creatures are outlaws? My suspicion is that the enchantment will still be strong under those conditions, making it a card that will range from good to great depending on your deck.\"}","{\"name\":\"Rattleback Apothecary\",\"rating\":3.0,\"comment\":\"Rattleback Apothecary joins a posse of black creatures that are solid on their own, and get even better when you start committing crimes.

Picture the baseline scenario where the opponent has three creatures and you spend four mana to force them to sacrifice two of them. That's a great effect! While it is possible for Rush to wind up weaker than that, it's more likely to scale up in power than down. When you start attacking life total, cards in hand, or consider board stall situations, things can get really scary.\"}","{\"name\":\"Unscrupulous Contractor\",\"rating\":3.0,\"comment\":\"This type of card is always solid, where you have the optionality of a creature, a card-drawing spell (should you choose to sacrifice the Contractor itself) or a valuable sacrifice outlet.

I'll sign up with the Unscrupulous Contractor.\"}","{\"name\":\"Vault Plunderer\",\"rating\":3.0,\"comment\":\"Vault Plunderer won't be as strong as  was in Streets of New Capenna.

That said, Boneyard Desecrator has reasonable stats and menace right up front, and I love that you can activate the ability at any time, rather than only at sorcery speed. There's no way this can be worse than a filler-level creature, and it could prove to be a bit better than that.\"}","{\"name\":\"Consuming Ashes\",\"rating\":2.5,\"comment\":\"Consuming Ashes is a little pricey, but you pay for quality. It's instant-speed, unconditional and even exiles the creature. Plus, surveil 2 is a nice bonus in the cases where you do wind up trading down on mana. I'm confident that the first copy will be a welcome addition to any black deck. Whether you'll be happy playing three or more copies remains to be seen.\"}","{\"name\":\"Pitiless Carnage\",\"rating\":1.5,\"comment\":\"Generally speaking, a permanent on the battlefield is going to be worth more than a card in your hand. However, there are some important exceptions, such as Treasure and Mercenary tokens, or excess lands in the very late game. I can envision games where you plot Pitiless Carnage, float a bunch of mana and draw eight cards off tokens and lands in the very late game.That said, you shouldn't put this in your deck without a very clear plan. If you find yourself sacrificing a land and your worst creature to draw two cards, you've gotten a terrible deal and I'll have no pity for you.\"}","{\"name\":\"Rictus Robber\",\"rating\":3.5,\"comment\":\"Once again we have a creature that needs to be evaluated across a range of possible outcomes. At worst, you have four mana for a 4/3 - passable but unexciting. At best, you have three mana for a 4/3 and a 2/2, which is game-breaking. I imagine that seeing the opponent plot Rictus Robber face up will make the game very stressful, as any future removal spell or trade in combat will allow them to generate a massive board. This is a big effect and an overall great card.\"}","{\"name\":\"Rooftop Assassin\",\"rating\":2.5,\"comment\":\"This creature takes a card template that has historically been \\\"just okay,\\\" and takes the power level through the roof.

She's difficult to kill, and if you commit even one crime while she's on the battlefield, you're almost certain to win the game.

However, if your deck is anything better than Gisa and 39 Swamps, you're not gonna have a hard time making her work.\"}","{\"name\":\"Overzealous Muscle\",\"rating\":2.0,\"comment\":\"Overzealous Muscle is the first black creature that hasn't jumped off the page for me. It's totally fine as a filler creature to top off your mana curve, but it's not better than that. Don't be overzealous in picking these, as they'll float around the table relatively late.\"}","{\"name\":\"Ambush Gigapede\",\"rating\":2.5,\"comment\":\"Ambush Gigapede is a scary card. It can come down and pick off a small creature, or you can flash it in at the end of the turn to set up a massive attack. You're getting what you pay for, but six mana is a lot. I'd expect most decks to want the first copy, but to hesitate at playing multiples.\"}","{\"name\":\"Hollow Marauder\",\"rating\":3.5,\"comment\":\"Similarly, Hollow Marauder gives you a ton of value in exchange for a (potentially) high price tag. It's realistic to wind up with three-for-one card advantage (imagine your opponent has cards to discard, but doesn't have or doesn't want to discard something expensive) and a massive flier that can end the game in short order.You can probably expect to cast Marauder for five mana in the normal course of a Limited game. It's probably not worth going far out of your way to power this out, although if you get multiples there might be some interesting things you can do.Top 5 Black CommonsBlack looks awesome, and I had trouble narrowing the commons down to just five. Honorable mention to , which is a great card and deserves to be on the list. Honorable mention to , which is tricky to evaluate, and could wind up being a great build-around for a top archetype.Even more than the commons, black's uncommons look like absolute bangers.

The second is if your opponent lets one trigger happen and then destroys Greed's Gambit.In the absence of those two fail cases, the card is quite powerful and I think I'd be willing to try it.
